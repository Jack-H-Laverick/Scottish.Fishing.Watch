#' Detect fishing effort by image analysis
#'
#'This function takes a collection of pixels and an image, and returns the proportion of area being fished.
#'
#'The vectors of pixels are used to create a mask which blanks out fishing in Non-Scottish waters.
#'The image is converted to black and white, and a threshold of 0.4 applied to remove land features while
#'retaining fishing activity. The proportion of bright pixels out of the pixels of interest indicates the
#'amount of fishing happening in the image.
#'
#' @param X A vector of X indices for pixels OUTISDE the target area.
#' @param Y A vector of Y indices for pixels OUTSIDE the target area.
#' @param map An image of class cimg.
#' @return The proportion of pixels within a region of interest which have fishing activity.
